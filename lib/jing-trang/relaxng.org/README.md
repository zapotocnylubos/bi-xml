# relaxng.org

25 November 2018

These are the files from the `relaxng.org` website as of
22 November 2018 with the following differences:

1. The `.backup` files have been removed.
2. Publishing from GitHub doesn’t support symoblic links so
   the previously linked documents are simple copies now.

Next steps are to get the DNS records updated so that this
site *becomes* https://relaxng.org/
