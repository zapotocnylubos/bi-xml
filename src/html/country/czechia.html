         <h1>Czechia</h1>
         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>At the close of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian
            Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, having rejected a
            federal system, the new country's predominantly Czech leaders were frequently preoccupied
            with meeting the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the
            republic, most notably the Slovaks, the Sudeten Germans, and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians).
            On the eve of World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the territory that today comprises
            Czechia, and Slovakia became an independent state allied with Germany. After the war,
            a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere
            of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the
            country's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create "socialism with a human
            face," ushering in a period of repression known as "normalization." The peaceful "Velvet
            Revolution" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated
            a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, the country underwent
            a nonviolent "velvet divorce" into its two national components, the Czech Republic
            and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.
            The country added the short-form name Czechia in 2016, while continuing to use the
            full form name, Czech Republic.</p>

         <h2>Economy</h2>
         <div>Czechia is a prosperous market economy that boasts one of the highest GDP growth rates
            and lowest unemployment levels in the EU, but its dependence on exports makes economic
            growth vulnerable to contractions in external demand. Czechia’s exports comprise some
            80% of GDP and largely consist of automobiles, the country’s single largest industry.
            Czechia acceded to the EU in 2004 but has yet to join the euro-zone. While the flexible
            koruna helps Czechia weather external shocks, it was one of the world’s strongest
            performing currencies in 2017, appreciating approximately 16% relative to the US dollar
            after the central bank (Czech National Bank - CNB) ended its cap on the currency’s
            value in early April 2017, which it had maintained since November 2013. The CNB hiked
            rates in August and November 2017 - the first rate changes in nine years - to address
            rising inflationary pressures brought by strong economic growth and a tight labor
            market.
            Since coming to power in 2014, the new government has undertaken some reforms to try
            to reduce corruption, attract investment, and improve social welfare programs, which
            could help increase the government’s revenues and improve living conditions for Czechs.
            The government introduced in December 2016 an online tax reporting system intended
            to reduce tax evasion and increase revenues. The government also plans to remove labor
            market rigidities to improve the business climate, bring procurement procedures in
            line with EU best practices, and boost wages. The country's low unemployment rate
            has led to steady increases in salaries, and the government is facing pressure from
            businesses to allow greater migration of qualified workers, at least from Ukraine
            and neighboring Central European countries.
            Long-term challenges include dealing with a rapidly aging population, a shortage of
            skilled workers, a lagging education system, funding an unsustainable pension and
            health care system, and diversifying away from manufacturing and toward a more high-tech,
            services-based, knowledge economy.</div>
