      <h1>Czechia</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>At the close of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian
         Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, having rejected a
         federal system, the new country's predominantly Czech leaders were frequently preoccupied
         with meeting the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the
         republic, most notably the Slovaks, the Sudeten Germans, and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians).
         On the eve of World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the territory that today comprises
         Czechia, and Slovakia became an independent state allied with Germany. After the war,
         a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere
         of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the
         country's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create "socialism with a human
         face," ushering in a period of repression known as "normalization." The peaceful "Velvet
         Revolution" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated
         a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, the country underwent
         a nonviolent "velvet divorce" into its two national components, the Czech Republic
         and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.
         The country added the short-form name Czechia in 2016, while continuing to use the
         full form name, Czech Republic.</p>

      <h2>Economy</h2>Czechia is a prosperous market economy that boasts one of the highest GDP growth rates
      and lowest unemployment levels in the EU, but its dependence on exports makes economic
      growth vulnerable to contractions in external demand. Czechia’s exports comprise some
      80% of GDP and largely consist of automobiles, the country’s single largest industry.
      Czechia acceded to the EU in 2004 but has yet to join the euro-zone. While the flexible
      koruna helps Czechia weather external shocks, it was one of the world’s strongest
      performing currencies in 2017, appreciating approximately 16% relative to the US dollar
      after the central bank (Czech National Bank - CNB) ended its cap on the currency’s
      value in early April 2017, which it had maintained since November 2013. The CNB hiked
      rates in August and November 2017 - the first rate changes in nine years - to address
      rising inflationary pressures brought by strong economic growth and a tight labor
      market.
      Since coming to power in 2014, the new government has undertaken some reforms to try
      to reduce corruption, attract investment, and improve social welfare programs, which
      could help increase the government’s revenues and improve living conditions for Czechs.
      The government introduced in December 2016 an online tax reporting system intended
      to reduce tax evasion and increase revenues. The government also plans to remove labor
      market rigidities to improve the business climate, bring procurement procedures in
      line with EU best practices, and boost wages. The country's low unemployment rate
      has led to steady increases in salaries, and the government is facing pressure from
      businesses to allow greater migration of qualified workers, at least from Ukraine
      and neighboring Central European countries.
      Long-term challenges include dealing with a rapidly aging population, a shortage of
      skilled workers, a lagging education system, funding an unsustainable pension and
      health care system, and diversifying away from manufacturing and toward a more high-tech,
      services-based, knowledge economy.375900000000USD2017360500000000USD2016351900000000USD201549data are in 2017 dollars21580000000020172.27%20193.18%20185.35%201712435500USD201734200USD201633400USD201557data are in 2017 dollars47.4%19.2%24.7%1.1%79.9%-72.3%20172.3%36.9%60.8%201726.9percent_of_gdp201727.5percent_of_gdp201628.2percent_of_gdp201545wheatpotatoessugar beetshopsfruitpigspoultry
