         <h1>Egypt</h1>
         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation
            provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the
            world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series
            of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty
            fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans,
            and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the
            7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the
            Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt
            by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 elevated Egypt
            as an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain
            seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman
            Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired
            full sovereignty from Britain in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971
            and the resultant Lake Nasser have reaffirmed the time-honored place of the Nile River
            in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest
            in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to
            overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands
            of Egypt's fast-growing population as it implements far-reaching economic reforms,
            including the reduction of select subsidies, large-scale infrastructure projects,
            energy cooperation, and foreign direct investment appeals.
            Inspired by the 2010 Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition groups led demonstrations
            and labor strikes countrywide, culminating in President Hosni MUBARAK's ouster in
            2011. Egypt's military assumed national leadership until a new legislature was in
            place in early 2012; later that same year, Muhammad MURSI won the presidential election.
            Following protests throughout the spring of 2013 against MURSI's government and the
            Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Armed Forces intervened and removed MURSI from power
            in July 2013 and replaced him with interim president Adly MANSOUR. Simultaneously,
            the government began enacting laws to limit freedoms of assembly and expression. In
            January 2014, voters approved a new constitution by referendum and in May 2014 elected
            former defense minister Abdelfattah ELSISI president. Egypt elected a new legislature
            in December 2015,&nbsp;its first Hose of Representatives since 2012. ELSISI was reelected
            to a second four-year term in March 2018. In April 2019, Egypt approved via national
            referendum a set of constitutional amendments extending ELSISI’s term in office through
            2024 and possibly through 2030 if re-elected for a third term. The amendments would
            also allow future presidents up to two consecutive six-year terms in office, re-establish
            an upper legislative house, allow for one or more vice presidents, establish a 25%
            quota for female legislators, reaffirm the military’s role as guardian of Egypt, and
            expand presidential authority to appoint the heads of judicial councils.</p>

         <h2>Economy</h2>
         <div>Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent, Egypt is bisected by the
            highly fertile Nile valley where most economic activity takes place. Egypt's economy
            was highly centralized during the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but
            opened up considerably under former Presidents Anwar EL-SADAT and Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK.
            Agriculture, hydrocarbons, manufacturing, tourism, and other service sectors drove
            the country’s relatively diverse economic activity.
            Despite Egypt’s mixed record for attracting foreign investment over the past two decades,
            poor living conditions and limited job opportunities have contributed to public discontent.
            These socioeconomic pressures were a major factor leading to the January 2011 revolution
            that ousted MUBARAK. The uncertain political, security, and policy environment since
            2011 has restricted economic growth and failed to alleviate persistent unemployment,
            especially among the young.
            In late 2016, persistent dollar shortages and waning aid from its Gulf allies led
            Cairo to turn to the IMF for a 3-year, $12 billion loan program. To secure the deal,
            Cairo floated its currency, introduced new taxes, and cut energy subsidies - all of
            which pushed inflation above 30% for most of 2017, a high that had not been seen in
            a generation. Since the currency float, foreign investment in Egypt’s high interest
            treasury bills has risen exponentially, boosting both dollar availability and central
            bank reserves. Cairo will be challenged to obtain foreign and local investment in
            manufacturing and other sectors without a sustained effort to implement a range of
            business reforms.</div>
