      <h1>Egypt</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation
         provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the
         world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series
         of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty
         fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans,
         and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the
         7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the
         Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt
         by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 elevated Egypt
         as an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain
         seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman
         Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired
         full sovereignty from Britain in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971
         and the resultant Lake Nasser have reaffirmed the time-honored place of the Nile River
         in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest
         in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to
         overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands
         of Egypt's fast-growing population as it implements far-reaching economic reforms,
         including the reduction of select subsidies, large-scale infrastructure projects,
         energy cooperation, and foreign direct investment appeals.
         Inspired by the 2010 Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition groups led demonstrations
         and labor strikes countrywide, culminating in President Hosni MUBARAK's ouster in
         2011. Egypt's military assumed national leadership until a new legislature was in
         place in early 2012; later that same year, Muhammad MURSI won the presidential election.
         Following protests throughout the spring of 2013 against MURSI's government and the
         Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Armed Forces intervened and removed MURSI from power
         in July 2013 and replaced him with interim president Adly MANSOUR. Simultaneously,
         the government began enacting laws to limit freedoms of assembly and expression. In
         January 2014, voters approved a new constitution by referendum and in May 2014 elected
         former defense minister Abdelfattah ELSISI president. Egypt elected a new legislature
         in December 2015,&nbsp;its first Hose of Representatives since 2012. ELSISI was reelected
         to a second four-year term in March 2018. In April 2019, Egypt approved via national
         referendum a set of constitutional amendments extending ELSISI’s term in office through
         2024 and possibly through 2030 if re-elected for a third term. The amendments would
         also allow future presidents up to two consecutive six-year terms in office, re-establish
         an upper legislative house, allow for one or more vice presidents, establish a 25%
         quota for female legislators, reaffirm the military’s role as guardian of Egypt, and
         expand presidential authority to appoint the heads of judicial councils.</p>

      Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world and the third most populous country
      in Africa, behind Nigeria and Ethiopia. Most of the country is desert, so about 95%
      of the population is concentrated in a narrow strip of fertile land along the Nile
      River, which represents only about 5% of Egypt’s land area. Egypt’s rapid population
      growth – 46% between 1994 and 2014 – stresses limited natural resources, jobs, housing,
      sanitation, education, and health care.
      Although the country’s total fertility rate (TFR) fell from roughly 5.5 children per
      woman in 1980 to just over 3 in the late 1990s, largely as a result of state-sponsored
      family planning programs, the population growth rate dropped more modestly because
      of decreased mortality rates and longer life expectancies. During the last decade,
      Egypt’s TFR decline stalled for several years and then reversed, reaching 3.6 in 2011,
      and has plateaued the last few years. Contraceptive use has held steady at about 60%,
      while preferences for larger families and early marriage may have strengthened in
      the wake of the recent 2011 revolution. The large cohort of women of or nearing childbearing
      age will sustain high population growth for the foreseeable future (an effect called
      population momentum).
      Nevertheless, post-MUBARAK governments have not made curbing population growth a priority.
      To increase contraceptive use and to prevent further overpopulation will require greater
      government commitment and substantial social change, including encouraging smaller
      families and better educating and empowering women. Currently, literacy, educational
      attainment, and labor force participation rates are much lower for women than men.
      In addition, the prevalence of violence against women, the lack of female political
      representation, and the perpetuation of the nearly universal practice of female genital
      cutting continue to keep women from playing a more significant role in Egypt’s public
      sphere.
      Population pressure, poverty, high unemployment, and the fragmentation of inherited
      land holdings have historically motivated Egyptians, primarily young men, to migrate
      internally from rural and smaller urban areas in the Nile Delta region and the poorer
      rural south to Cairo, Alexandria, and other urban centers in the north, while a much
      smaller number migrated to the Red Sea and Sinai areas. Waves of forced internal migration
      also resulted from the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and the floods caused by the completion
      of the Aswan High Dam in 1970. Limited numbers of students and professionals emigrated
      temporarily prior to the early 1970s, when economic problems and high unemployment
      pushed the Egyptian Government to lift restrictions on labor migration. At the same
      time, high oil revenues enabled Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Gulf states, as well
      as Libya and Jordan, to fund development projects, creating a demand for unskilled
      labor (mainly in construction), which attracted tens of thousands of young Egyptian
      men.
      Between 1970 and 1974 alone, Egyptian migrants in the Gulf countries increased from
      approximately 70,000 to 370,000. Egyptian officials encouraged legal labor migration
      both to alleviate unemployment and to generate remittance income (remittances continue
      to be one of Egypt’s largest sources of foreign currency and GDP). During the mid-1980s,
      however, depressed oil prices resulting from the Iran-Iraq War, decreased demand for
      low-skilled labor, competition from less costly South Asian workers, and efforts to
      replace foreign workers with locals significantly reduced Egyptian migration to the
      Gulf States. The number of Egyptian migrants dropped from a peak of almost 3.3 million
      in 1983 to about 2.2 million at the start of the 1990s, but numbers gradually recovered.
      In the 2000s, Egypt began facilitating more labor migration through bilateral agreements,
      notably with Arab countries and Italy, but illegal migration to Europe through overstayed
      visas or maritime human smuggling via Libya also rose. The Egyptian Government estimated
      there were 6.5 million Egyptian migrants in 2009, with roughly 75% being temporary
      migrants in other Arab countries (Libya, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and the United
      Arab Emirates) and 25% being predominantly permanent migrants in the West (US, UK,
      Italy, France, and Canada).
      During the 2000s, Egypt became an increasingly important transit and destination country
      for economic migrants and asylum seekers, including Palestinians, East Africans, and
      South Asians and, more recently, Iraqis and Syrians. Egypt draws many refugees because
      of its resettlement programs with the West; Cairo has one of the largest urban refugee
      populations in the world. Many East African migrants are interned or live in temporary
      encampments along the Egypt-Israel border, and some have been shot and killed by Egyptian
      border guards.

      <h2>Economy</h2>Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent, Egypt is bisected by the
      highly fertile Nile valley where most economic activity takes place. Egypt's economy
      was highly centralized during the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but
      opened up considerably under former Presidents Anwar EL-SADAT and Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK.
      Agriculture, hydrocarbons, manufacturing, tourism, and other service sectors drove
      the country’s relatively diverse economic activity.
      Despite Egypt’s mixed record for attracting foreign investment over the past two decades,
      poor living conditions and limited job opportunities have contributed to public discontent.
      These socioeconomic pressures were a major factor leading to the January 2011 revolution
      that ousted MUBARAK. The uncertain political, security, and policy environment since
      2011 has restricted economic growth and failed to alleviate persistent unemployment,
      especially among the young.
      In late 2016, persistent dollar shortages and waning aid from its Gulf allies led
      Cairo to turn to the IMF for a 3-year, $12 billion loan program. To secure the deal,
      Cairo floated its currency, introduced new taxes, and cut energy subsidies - all of
      which pushed inflation above 30% for most of 2017, a high that had not been seen in
      a generation. Since the currency float, foreign investment in Egypt’s high interest
      treasury bills has risen exponentially, boosting both dollar availability and central
      bank reserves. Cairo will be challenged to obtain foreign and local investment in
      manufacturing and other sectors without a sustained effort to implement a range of
      business reforms.1204000000000USD20171155000000000USD20161107000000000USD201521data are in 2017 dollars23650000000020174.2%20174.3%20164.4%20156812700USD201712800USD201612400USD2015124data are in 2017 dollars86.8%10.1%14.8%0.5%16.3%-28.5%201711.7%34.3%54%20179percent_of_gdp20179.1percent_of_gdp201610.6percent_of_gdp2015166cottonricecornwheatbeansfruitsvegetablescattlewater buffalosheepgoats

      to sex trafficking and forced labor; Egyptian children, including the large population
      of street children are vulnerable to forced labor in domestic service, begging and
      agriculture or may be victims of sex trafficking or child sex tourism, which occurs
      in Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor; some Egyptian women and girls are sold into "temporary"
      or "summer" marriages with Gulf men, through the complicity of their parents or marriage
      brokers, and are exploited for prostitution or forced labor; Egyptian men are subject
      to forced labor in neighboring countries, while adults from South and Southeast Asia
      and East Africa – and increasingly Syrian refugees – are forced to work in domestic
      service, construction, cleaning, and begging in Egypt; women and girls, including
      migrants and refugees, from Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East are sex
      trafficked in Egypt; the Egyptian military cracked down on criminal group’s smuggling,
      abducting, trafficking, and extorting African migrants in the Sinai Peninsula, but
      the practice has reemerged along Egypt’s western border with LibyaTier 2 Watch List – Egypt does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the
      elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the
      government gathered data nationwide on trafficking cases to better allocate and prioritize
      anti-trafficking efforts, but overall it did not demonstrate increased progress; prosecutions
      increased in 2014, but no offenders were convicted for the second consecutive year;
      fewer trafficking victims were identified in 2014, which represents a significant
      and ongoing decrease from the previous two reporting periods; the government relied
      on NGOs and international organizations to identify and refer victims to protective
      services, and focused on Egyptian victims and refused to provide some services to
      foreign victims, at times including shelter (2015)transit point for cannabis, heroin, and opium moving to Europe, Israel, and North
      Africa; transit stop for Nigerian drug couriers; concern as money laundering site
