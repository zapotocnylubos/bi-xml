      <h1>Greece</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830. During the second half
         of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring
         islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II, Greece
         was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44);
         fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other
         anti-communist and communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949, Greece
         joined NATO in 1952. In 1967, a group of military officers seized power, establishing
         a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king
         to flee the country. In 1974 following the collapse of the dictatorship, democratic
         elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy.
         In 1981, Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European
         Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2001. Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis
         since late 2009, due to nearly a decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities.&nbsp;Beginning
         in&nbsp;2010, Greece entered three bailout agreements - with the European Commission, the
         European Central Bank (ECB), the IMF, and&nbsp;the third in 2015 with&nbsp;the European Stability
         Mechanism (ESM) - worth in total about $300 billion. The Greek Government formally
         exited the third bailout in August 2018.</p>

      <h2>Economy</h2>Greece has a capitalist economy with a public sector accounting for about 40% of GDP
      and with per capita GDP about two-thirds that of the leading euro-zone economies.
      Tourism provides 18% of GDP. Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force,
      mainly in agricultural and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid,
      equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP.
      The Greek economy averaged growth of about 4% per year between 2003 and 2007, but
      the economy went into recession in 2009 as a result of the world financial crisis,
      tightening credit conditions, and Athens' failure to address a growing budget deficit.
      By 2013, the economy had contracted 26%, compared with the pre-crisis level of 2007.
      Greece met the EU's Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit criterion of no more
      than 3% of GDP in 2007-08, but violated it in 2009, when the deficit reached 15% of
      GDP. Deteriorating public finances, inaccurate and misreported statistics, and consistent
      underperformance on reforms prompted major credit rating agencies to downgrade Greece's
      international debt rating in late 2009 and led the country into a financial crisis.
      Under intense pressure from the EU and international market participants, the government
      accepted a bailout program that called on Athens to cut government spending, decrease
      tax evasion, overhaul the civil-service, health-care, and pension systems, and reform
      the labor and product markets. Austerity measures reduced the deficit to 1.3% in 2017.
      Successive Greek governments, however, failed to push through many of the most unpopular
      reforms in the face of widespread political opposition, including from the country's
      powerful labor unions and the general public.
      In April 2010, a leading credit agency assigned Greek debt its lowest possible credit
      rating, and in May 2010, the IMF and euro-zone governments provided Greece emergency
      short- and medium-term loans worth $147 billion so that the country could make debt
      repayments to creditors. Greece, however, struggled to meet the targets set by the
      EU and the IMF, especially after Eurostat - the EU's statistical office - revised
      upward Greece's deficit and debt numbers for 2009 and 2010. European leaders and the
      IMF agreed in October 2011 to provide Athens a second bailout package of $169 billion.
      The second deal called for holders of Greek government bonds to write down a significant
      portion of their holdings to try to alleviate Greece’s government debt burden. However,
      Greek banks, saddled with a significant portion of sovereign debt, were adversely
      affected by the write down and $60 billion of the second bailout package was set aside
      to ensure the banking system was adequately capitalized.
      In 2014, the Greek economy began to turn the corner on the recession. Greece achieved
      three significant milestones: balancing the budget - not including debt repayments;
      issuing government debt in financial markets for the first time since 2010; and generating
      0.7% GDP growth — the first economic expansion since 2007.
      Despite the nascent recovery, widespread discontent with austerity measures helped
      propel the far-left Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) party into government in
      national legislative elections in January 2015. Between January and July 2015, frustrations
      grew between the SYRIZA-led government and Greece’s EU and IMF creditors over the
      implementation of bailout measures and disbursement of funds. The Greek government
      began running up significant arrears to suppliers, while Greek banks relied on emergency
      lending, and Greece’s future in the euro zone was called into question. To stave off
      a collapse of the banking system, Greece imposed capital controls in June 2015, then
      became the first developed nation to miss a loan payment to the IMF, rattling international
      financial markets. Unable to reach an agreement with creditors, Prime Minister Alexios
      TSIPRAS held a nationwide referendum on 5 July on whether to accept the terms of Greece’s
      bailout, campaigning for the ultimately successful "no" vote. The TSIPRAS government
      subsequently agreed, however, to a new $96 billion bailout in order to avert Greece’s
      exit from the monetary bloc. On 20 August 2015, Greece signed its third bailout, allowing
      it to cover significant debt payments to its EU and IMF creditors and to ensure the
      banking sector retained access to emergency liquidity. The TSIPRAS government — which
      retook office on 20 September 2015 after calling new elections in late August — successfully
      secured disbursal of two delayed tranches of bailout funds. Despite the economic turmoil,
      Greek GDP did not contract as sharply as feared, boosted in part by a strong tourist
      season.
      In 2017, Greece saw improvements in GDP and unemployment. Unfinished economic reforms,
      a massive non-performing loan problem, and ongoing uncertainty regarding the political
      direction of the country hold the economy back. Some estimates put Greece’s black
      market at 20- to 25% of GDP, as more people have stopped reporting their income to
      avoid paying taxes that, in some cases, have risen to 70% of an individual’s gross
      income.299300000000USD2017295300000000USD2016296000000000USD201556data are in 2017 dollars20070000000020171.87%20191.91%20181.44%201714527800USD201727400USD201627300USD201575data are in 2017 dollars69.6%20.1%12.5%-1%33.4%-34.7%20174.1%16.9%79.1%201710.9percent_of_gdp20179.5percent_of_gdp20169.6percent_of_gdp2015159wheatcornbarleysugar beetsolivestomatoeswinetobaccopotatoesbeefdairy products
