         <h1>Italy</h1>
         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along
            with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary
            government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a
            Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World
            War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed.
            Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and its
            subsequent successors the EC and the EU. It has been at the forefront of European
            economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.
            Persistent problems include sluggish economic growth, high youth and female unemployment,
            organized crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy and the
            more prosperous north.</p>

         <h2>Economy</h2>
         <div>Italy’s economy comprises a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies,
            and a less-developed, highly subsidized, agricultural south, with a legacy of unemployment
            and underdevelopment. The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture
            of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many
            of them family-owned. Italy also has a sizable underground economy, which by some
            estimates accounts for as much as 17% of GDP. These activities are most common within
            the agriculture, construction, and service sectors.
            Italy is the third-largest economy in the euro zone, but its exceptionally high public
            debt and structural impediments to growth have rendered it vulnerable to scrutiny
            by financial markets. Public debt has increased steadily since 2007, reaching 131%
            of GDP in 2017. Investor concerns about Italy and the broader euro-zone crisis eased
            in 2013, bringing down Italy's borrowing costs on sovereign government debt from euro-era
            records. The government still faces pressure from investors and European partners
            to sustain its efforts to address Italy's longstanding structural economic problems,
            including labor market inefficiencies, a sluggish judicial system, and a weak banking
            sector. Italy’s economy returned to modest growth in late 2014 for the first time
            since 2011. In 2015-16, Italy’s economy grew at about 1% each year, and in 2017 growth
            accelerated to 1.5% of GDP. In 2017, overall unemployment was 11.4%, but youth unemployment
            remained high at 37.1%. GDP growth is projected to slow slightly in 2018.</div>
