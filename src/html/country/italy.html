      <h1>Italy</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along
         with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary
         government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a
         Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World
         War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed.
         Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and its
         subsequent successors the EC and the EU. It has been at the forefront of European
         economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.
         Persistent problems include sluggish economic growth, high youth and female unemployment,
         organized crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy and the
         more prosperous north.</p>

      Etna, along with the famous Vesuvius, which remains a threat to the millions of nearby
      residents in the Bay of Naples area, have both been deemed Decade Volcanoes by the
      International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy
      of study due to their explosive history and close proximity to human populations;

      of 10 November 2020, Italy has reported a total of 902,490 cases of COVID-19 or 14,927
      cumulative cases of COVID-19 per 1 million population with 679 cumulative deaths per
      1 million population; the US Department of State has issued a Travel Advisory to reconsider
      travel to Italy due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19; the Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention has also recommended postponing nonessential travel to Italy at this
      time and published additional guidance at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/coronavirus-italy;

      <h2>Economy</h2>Italy’s economy comprises a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies,
      and a less-developed, highly subsidized, agricultural south, with a legacy of unemployment
      and underdevelopment. The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture
      of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many
      of them family-owned. Italy also has a sizable underground economy, which by some
      estimates accounts for as much as 17% of GDP. These activities are most common within
      the agriculture, construction, and service sectors.
      Italy is the third-largest economy in the euro zone, but its exceptionally high public
      debt and structural impediments to growth have rendered it vulnerable to scrutiny
      by financial markets. Public debt has increased steadily since 2007, reaching 131%
      of GDP in 2017. Investor concerns about Italy and the broader euro-zone crisis eased
      in 2013, bringing down Italy's borrowing costs on sovereign government debt from euro-era
      records. The government still faces pressure from investors and European partners
      to sustain its efforts to address Italy's longstanding structural economic problems,
      including labor market inefficiencies, a sluggish judicial system, and a weak banking
      sector. Italy’s economy returned to modest growth in late 2014 for the first time
      since 2011. In 2015-16, Italy’s economy grew at about 1% each year, and in 2017 growth
      accelerated to 1.5% of GDP. In 2017, overall unemployment was 11.4%, but youth unemployment
      remained high at 37.1%. GDP growth is projected to slow slightly in 2018.2317000000000USD20172282000000000USD20162263000000000USD201512data are in 2017 dollars193900000000020170.34%20190.83%20181.73%201718838200USD201737600USD201637200USD201550data are in 2017 dollars61%18.6%17.5%-0.2%31.4%-28.3%20172.1%23.9%73.9%201720.3percent_of_gdp201719.7percent_of_gdp201618.8percent_of_gdp201595fruitsvegetablesgrapespotatoessugar beetssoybeansgrainolivesbeefdairy productsfish
